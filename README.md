# DS-Android-PSVita
attempt to distribute a DS emulator across an android phone and a PlayStation Vita. The Android device does the computation and displays the DS top screen. Over an Ad-hoc wifi network the second display is streamed to the vita while the vitas inputs are utilized and sent to the android. MAJOR WORK IN PROGRESS.
